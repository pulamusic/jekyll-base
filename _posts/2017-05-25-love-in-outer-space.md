Lots of auxiliary percussion. In fact, too much for my taste. It's all over the place. The organ sounds a bit cheesy. I think this tune sounds like a bossa-nova-type tune, in fact. It would be a cool arrangement.

The version of this tune is from *A Quiet Place in the Universe*. I need to find another version of the same tune. This version has no horns, only percussion and organ. I don't have a sense for the melody of the tune, and I'm wondering if another album might have a better version. In fact, I should look for the first studio recording of the tune. This album is live at a small club. At least that's how it sounds to me.

I swear, the whole horn section must be playing percussion. It improved when there were percussion solos, but this is too much.

Here's a better version of the tune. More piano, plus a guitar solo.
