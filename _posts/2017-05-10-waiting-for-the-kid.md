I'm waiting for the kid to come home from her first day ate a new school. I think on days like this I may be more nervous than she is. One thing I know about Zanaya is that she is very sociable, much more so than me. If I could get through this kind of first day stuff when I was a kid, she can do it much better I'm sure.

One of the issues I am running into with this freewriting blog is that I am short on actual ideas. Maybe I should also brainstorm and outline ideas before I freewrite. I'll try that out later today.

But for now I'm just waiting. Apparently she is doing some online stuff at this new school, trying to work out the final six weeks of the 9th grade curriculum. I really hope the kid has an opportunity to catch up to her peers. I fear that we've kind of fucked her over with the move to North Star; she needs the structure of a school.

So the kid is home now. Here's a quote, "Didn't see anyone I know, sat by myself, didn't talk to no one." Charming. This is going to be an adjustment.
