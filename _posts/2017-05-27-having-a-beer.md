 Let me take a break from the movie I'm watching to write a bit. I won't pressure myself to keep on until I hit my mark. Just a little at a time.

 I drove all the way to Northampton today to buy weed at the dispensary. Even though my card says it expires next month, apparently my prescription expired yesterday. All that way for nothing. I love weed, but I can't say that I'm anxious about being out of it.I do love weed though. It's a contemplative thing for me. I love to get stoned and read or play the guitar...or write for that matter. It really lets me relax into it. It's entirely possible, of course, that I suck at writing when stoned, but who cares really? I love weed.

 Now it's the next day and I am drinking orange juice with ice. I don't have anything to say just now, so let me post this and write more later.
