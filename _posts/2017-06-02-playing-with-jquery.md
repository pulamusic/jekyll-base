jQuery is so much easier than JavaScript I wonder what the advantage of full-blown JavaScript is. I know that jQuery is just a subset of JavaScript, but it is so useful it may cover everything I need from JavaScript for now. If I concentrate my efforts on jQuery, then, I may make better progress with coding in general. JavaScript is the big hangup for me.

And as I wrote in a previous post, maybe I should put JavaScript on the back burner for now. In addition to jQuery I could reacquaint myself with Python. I have a feeling that Python's simplicity, combined with jQuery, ought to add up to a pretty powerful coding package. Of course, Ruby would be more helpful in learning how to play around with Jekyll, but let me not bite off more than I can chew. Stick with jQuery for now.

I would like, though, to create a sidebar on my Jekyll page. I like the sidebar in WordPress, but I also love the simplicity of Jekyll. Just a couple of items in a sidebar would really be cool. I need to look at the Jekyll documentation regarding themes and navigation to see if I can tweak the site. Always remember to read-search-ask.

It's some hours later and I have just finished driving the kid to a movie. I'm alone again tonight since she is sleeping over at her friend's house. I'd love to go get some beer, but I am going to have to drive later.

I wrote a long email to VJ yesterday, and as I expected, no response. I swear the woman is emotionally constipated.

This has me distracted. I'm going to post this and start again with the writing tomorrow.
