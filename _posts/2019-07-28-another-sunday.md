It's just another Sunday in the shelter. Since the libraries are closed on Sundays I go to Dunkin Donuts for a few hours of internet usage. I'm back at the shelter now, using my phone as a hotspot so I can write for this blog. I've spent the day so far on laundry and coding. Let me break it down a bit.

I tried to deploy two Python apps to Heroku, but neither one is working at the moment. Here they are:
* **[Flaskr](https://aqueous-plateau-82023.herokuapp.com/)**: This is a basic blog-type app that is part of a [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/). It works well on the development server, but so far I have not been able to successfully deploy it to Heroku. I wish there was a simpler system for deploying Flask apps.
* **[Books Database](https://ancient-badlands-17140.herokuapp.com/)**: This app uses a PostgreSQL database of 5000 books that is hosted on Heroku. I have tried deploying the app to Heroku, but as with the previous app it isn't working so far. Check out the repo's [README file](https://github.com/pulamusic/project1) for a description of the app and what it can do.

I don't really have much to say other than to list what I worked on and where I deployed some code. Let me not get hung up on my 500 word minimum. This post is going to hover around 250 words, in fact.

Ah, fuck it.
