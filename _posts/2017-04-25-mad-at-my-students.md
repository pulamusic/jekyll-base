#Some days teaching can be a real drag

I found two of my students sleeping in class today. One woman actually had her head down on the desk and she had an attitude when I asked her to lift up her head. It's all so incredibly disrespectful, I don't really know how best to deal with it. So far what I have done is to let my displeasure be known. Maybe that's enough.

The other student dozed off and started snoring a little. I have been steaming since. I'm glad I didn't speak up about the second infraction. I might have said something I might regret.

Actually, I'm so mad I can't think straight. Let me not torture myself.
