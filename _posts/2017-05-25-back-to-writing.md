Enough with my money problems for now. I dropped some paperwork off at the DOR office downtown, so I assume things are being straightened out. At least I hope so.

Back to the writing. For the past couple of days I have produced more than one post per day, and that is feeling ok. Perhaps it is time for me to consciously increase my output. I need to commit myself to a decent length per blog post as well as to two posts per day. That ought to beef up my writing.

Just as a reminder, the overall goal of this freewriting blog is to become more comfortable with writing at the keyboard. I still prefer writing by hand, but it would be good to try to remove a step from the writing process.

So for now, two or more posts per day, and a decent word count. In fact, maybe I should be writing in MS Word so I can use the word count function. I would still need to copy and paste the text to a text editor in order to write clean code, but especially once I start writing more substantial posts I will need all the writerly functions of a word processor, like the ability to add citations.

So I just copied and pasted this text to a word processor. The text through the last paragraph is 212 words. Maybe I should be shooting for between 250-300 words per blog post. This is helpful.

And now I've hit the 250 mark. It adds up quickly.

But back to a previous post where I wrote about next steps for this blog. If I want to continue with freewriting I should probably go for the Sun Ra listening journal idea. I still need to come up with a framework for listening. In fact, that should be the first task of the blog - brainstorm and edit together a rough framework for listening. I need to choose the albums and compositions I am going to give a close listen, and just dive in. A goal could be to create a framework for listening through the process of listening to the first album. Of course a framework can always be revisited, but there needs to be something that assures some consistency in the writing across all blog posts. It could even be that I revise earlier posts to reflect some important aspect of the music I only caught onto later on down the line.

Now I'm up to 414 words as of the last paragraph.
