Again this morning, an epic battle over the phone. This morning she was bawling out her mother for not giving her money. Swearing and all. What a fucking pain in the ass.

I'm not sure this freewriting stuff is working for me. I need a book to help me with the writing. I seem to remember the book *Writing Strategies* was full of practical advice on how to get unstuck.

Fuck it, this freewriting stuff is whacked. I can't seem to sustain any lengthy burst of writing. I'm still...

Off she goes again, yelling at someone. I'll tell you, it must be really difficult to be a member of her family. Maybe they're all like that, who knows?

Really, I'm having trouble sustaining my thoughts today. One thing I'm doing today is worrying if I am writing with any depth at all. Among the writing exercises I do maybe I should practice drilling down on an idea, practice writing full paragraphs based on one idea only. Freewriting itself is ok, but at some point there needs to be some structure to the writing I produce.

I also need to reevaluate this idea that freewriting is always only automated - that there can't be any interruptions, pauses. I don't think in a continuous stream, it ebbs and flows. Maybe the act of writing should be full of pauses, like the text itself.
