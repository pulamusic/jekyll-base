# I want these fucking headlines to work

The Massachusetts DOR has put a lien on all of my bank accounts, so I can't do a damn thing. Now I can't buy groceries, pay my rent, anything. The lady at the DOR wants a copy of my 2008 tax return in order to get me "current." I really have no idea what that means, to get me current, and I have no idea where my 2008 tax return is. This is a total cluster fuck.

And I had been having a good day, thinking about the possibility of working at Berklee. It would be great to get back into an environment where I could practice every day. I really want musical practice to be part of my academic routine, and that is only going to happen if I work at Berklee. Even a regular music department at another college or university would probably require too much academically to be able to maintain any kind of substantial practice routine. Berklee, for many musicians, is the ultimate teaching gig. At least that's the way it seems from the outside.

I better get back on the phone with the DOR in order to sort out the cluster fuck. Damn I'm in a pissy mood just now.
