I've continued to work on my coding skills while I am still at mom's house (I should have enough money in my bank account tomorrow in order to get home). I have been working on my JavaScript and jQuery skills, so let me share a few things I have done and write some commentary.

---

**[A URL Shortener/Expander](https://pulamusic.github.io/AJAXRequestPractice/index.html)**: I haven't posted this app on the internet yet - I'll update this post when I do - but I just created a JavaScript app, through a Codecademy tutorial, for both shortening long URLs and expanded already-shortened URLs. I know I can shorten a URL with [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/), but my app takes advantage of the Google URL shortener API. It's an interesting exercise, and I think I can reuse the JavaScript structure in creating other apps that make use of other APIs. I did, at one point, create a [weather app on Codepen](https://codepen.io/pulamusic/pen/jBZLMp) (for some reason it no longer works), but this URL shortening/lengthening app works perfectly so far.

> NOTE: I have now uploaded this app to my GitHub account, and it is working well. I have added a link to the app both above as well as [here](https://pulamusic.github.io/AJAXRequestPractice/index.html).

**[jQuery Box Toggle](https://pulamusic.github.io/box_toggle.html)**: This page, and the next page, are silly examples I created just messing around with jQuery. I think I got the code from the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) site, essentially forking the code from the examples they give for every coding problem they can think of. In fact, here is the basic jQuery code I think I borrowed:

> `$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $("p").toggle();
    });
});`

It doesn't seem to print in this post as I structure it on a page, but, nonetheless, this is the code.

**[jQuery Slide Toggle](https://pulamusic.github.io/slide_toggle.html)**: This is another silly page that shows another way to show/hide elements on a page. I believe this is the code I forked:

> `$("button").click(function(){
    $("p").slideToggle();
});`

**[Bootstrap Modal](https://pulamusic.github.io/modal.html)**: Again, a silly page - I basically just used one doctored photo of Sun Ra for all three pages - that gives an example of a modal created using the Bootstrap HTML/CSS framework. The code I forked for this one is a bit too complex to cite like I have done above, but [here](https://github.com/pulamusic/pulamusic.github.io/blob/master/modal.html) is a link to the code as it resides on my GitHub account. No big deal in general, but it is just some fun I have had with coding.

Ultimately, I would like to parley these coding skills into being able to participate in some aspect of the digital humanities. Really, any coding I do related to my academic work can be considered to be a contribution to the digital humanities, but I need to figure out some way to formalize my participation. Probably the best way for me to do this would be to create a substantive website about my work.

I like the idea of creating a site using nothing but my coding skills and a text editor. In fact, I should really work on the [GitHub Pages portfolio site](https://pulamusic.github.io/index.html) I have already created, putting forward a professional portfolio that highlights my work and my skills. That would be the easiest and most honest way to do it.
