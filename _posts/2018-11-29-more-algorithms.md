Here is another list of JavaScript algorithms I have coded out on Repl.it, all taken from the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). Each of these algorithms is a discrete problem that can be solved in a number of ways using any of a number of programming languages. In my case, I have put a bunch of effort into learning JavaScript since it is the so-called "language of the internet." At some point it may be worth my while to re-do these algorithms in either Python or C - they really aren't specific to any one language.

In any event, here they are to look at, consider, re-factor, and re-do. Almost all of the algorithm files include a detailed description of the requirements, and this is why I haven't written a description of each algorithm in this blog post.
