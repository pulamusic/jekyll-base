It is 9:30, and only one student has shown up. I am going to write for five minutes and then see where we are with these kids. Usually there are two yound women who come early. Today, the only person who showed up on time is someone who is usually late.

9:32 and three students came in through the door. I'm still going to wait.

Four students. It's possible I may be teaching to four students today. Damn it.

So I guess I'll keep writing for a few minutes. My Powerpoint is ready, or at least as ready as I could be this morning. I had one of those mornings when I set the alarm for 3:00, but when I dozed a bit I woke up more than an hour later. That's the kind of morning I've had so far - everything feels behind.

I'm going to post this now and write more later.
