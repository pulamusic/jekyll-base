I'm fucking off yet another day as an unemployed bum, and, of course, I don't feel good about it. I just saw a story from the Young Turks that featured an asshole on Fox News who claimed that the real problem with welfare services these days is that people are no longer ashamed of the need to use these services. According to the asshole, welfare recipients watch TV and porn all day long and simply act as if their welfare benefits are entitlements.

# Asshole. Fox News asshole.

Rather than get into it, let me write some more about coding. I haven't been doing much of it lately, but I think about it. Let me break it down a bit.

* **JavaScript**: This is the Rosetta Stone of coding, and I really need to put more honest effort into it. I say honest effort because I find myself so often searching for coding solutions on the internet rather than working the code out totally on my own. In fact, this is a real problem. I need to be more insistent with myself about it, but I have gotten pretty good at sourcing problems from GitHub and Stack Overflow and other online spaces for coding. I really need to get more comfortable with the code itself.
* **JavaScript development environment**: When I talk about a development environment, I mean the use of NPM to manage development and production dependencies. I've done this for some Udemy tutorials, but I can't say that I know how to use it in my own projects. This is an aspect of coding I need to work on.
* **Data visualization**: I got a taste of this when working on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, but I need to work on it some more. I have a feeling that it will be very helpful for producing materials in the digital humanities. This is, ultimately, my goal with coding.
* **Python**: I have a feeling that Python will be of use for me when working in the digital humanities. It is supposed to be a useful language when dealing with large data sets. But again, as with JavaScript, I don't feel like I work honestly with this language. What I really should do is to re-do a number of sections of the EdX CS50 course in order to make sure I am truly getting the concepts. I feel like I totally fell apart when I got to the Python section, mostly because we had gone quickly from small coding projects to very large projects. I got hung up on a Python project and stopped doing the course. At some point I need to get back to it.
* **Coding portfolio**: I like the portfolio I have, but it may be to my advantage to create a site without using Bootstrap. Let me think a bit about this, though. I'll have to start with a full proposal write-up and some wireframes. For now, though, maybe I can do something like add smooth scrolling to the site. That's a small thing, but I think it looks slick. Another thing I can do is to change the color palette of the site; I don't like it as it is. It doesn't really represent my vision of what the site should look like.
