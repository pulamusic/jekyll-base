I don't have anything much to say today. I'm still mad at my students, and this is affecting my preparation for my next class. I have been procrastinating all afternoon. All I need to do is add the text to my Powerpoint. I have a feeling I'll be up at around 3:00 AM working on this stuff. Sometimes it is best to forget about it for a while and start again in the morning.

Again, I don't have anything much to say.
