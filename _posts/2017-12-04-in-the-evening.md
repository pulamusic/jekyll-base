Actually, it's still morning, but I'm listening to Led Zeppelin just now and the song "In the Evening" is just killing me. Bonham's drums have a very simple but not simplistic feel to them. He really had a great swing feel that made all of their music feel laid back, even while the rest of the band was leaning forward. Great stuff.

Today I'm back to writing for the sake of writing, so let me just let it flow. I suppose I'll write some more about coding since that is what I have been working on lately, but for now let me just write. I find, lately, that I can write with little effort. Freewriting is really helping me to relax about writing and just flow with it. I find that What I write is coherent and really only in need of added substance. What I mean is that I'm not doing any directed freewriting or academic freewriting, so I can't really count it as being substantive. It is well formed, though, and usually stands on its own as writing.

That all being said, let me move on to writing a bit about coding. I have been drilling down on it a bit lately, so let me see where it goes today.

**CSS/Sass**: Sass is promoted as being a simpler framework for creating large CSS files, but I can't see it yet. I guess the CSS files I have created are not large enough to warrant the use of Sass, so, in a way, taking this tutorial is a bit premature. Maybe I should just use it anyway in order to get used to the stuff. I don't really feel like I use the full potential of CSS as it is, though I can do a few things well enough. Just keep at it, I suppose.

**Full-Stack Coding/Development**: I'm not 100% sure what full-stack really means, but I think it refers to a person who has enough coding skills under their belt that they can develop an entire platform, from HTML to JavaScript to deployment. This is an issue for me since I joined Codecademy Pro because I placed myself on what they call the full-stack path. Essentially, it just refers to a collection of their coding tutorials that add up to a full-stack development skillset. I added the jQuery tutorial to their list of tutorials - not sure why it wasn't there in the first place - so really I am on a custom path, but my path includes all of the full-stack info.

**JavaScript/jQuery**: One interesting thing about joining Codecademy Pro is that the tutorials I thought I had finished are now only partly done. The JavaScript tutorial, for instance, is now marked as only 30% done, when just last week it was 100%. I look forward to getting some more experience with JavaScript, although I have to say that I have been understanding it a bit more lately. It's just one of those things that becomes more clear with time, I guess. If I can get anywhere near good with JavaScript and jQuery I should be able to develop some interesting interactive features to websites and apps.

**React &amp; Ruby**: These are some aspects of coding I have not dealt with at all yet. I know that React is a JavaScript platform, so it will be interesting to see if JavaScript coding becomes any easier or clearer while learning React. Ruby seems to be something altogether different, so I'm not sure what to expect there. I guess Ruby is the basic language, while Ruby on Rails is the more in-demand application of Ruby. I'll get to it at some point, but I still feel like I'm just working on the basics of coding.
