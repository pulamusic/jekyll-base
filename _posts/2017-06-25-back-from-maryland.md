I'm back from Maryland. I drove down on Friday and back on Sunday - today. Driving down was cool. We left at 3:30 in the morning and pulled up at my brother's house by 10:30, stopping only once for food and gas, Zanaya was on her headphones/phone or sleeping the whole way.

The drive back was terrible. I left my brother's house at about 10:30, got caught behind two accidents (bad accidents), caught in rush hour traffic on a Sunday, of all days, in NY, going across the George Washington Bridge through the Bronx and the beginning of upstate, into Connecticut, congested through New Haven and Hartford and pretty much all the way home.

I'm not freewriting today for some reason. I worked on that last paragraph from word to word, not flowing in any way. Somehow I am writing much more consciously, writing only a few words at a time. Is it because I'm stoned? Yes, that's it. Ah well, what the fuck. I may as well go with it.

My brother's family seemed to be getting along marvelously well, Andrew graduated high school despite missing about 50% of his classes for the year, Molly seems as together as she always is, B & B seem happy, Zanaya stared at her phone for most of the day, and probably into the night....

Ee gads, I began this post two days ago and only just got back to it on Tuesday afternoon. Let me post this as it is and begin over again with a new post. Only c.270 words.
