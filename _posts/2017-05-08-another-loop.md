I am going to try out exactly 5 minutes of freewriting, so I have set a timer and I am typing away. I'm going to keep going until the timer goes off.

This writing stuff is ok, maybe a bit frustrating just now. I don't seem to be able to stick exactly to the task while I am doing this. I have paused a number of times and spoken to Zanaya since I turned on the timer. My purpose here is to get a sense for just how much text I can produce in five minutes. So I'll just keep going.

I am getting frustrated with my efforts to get Zanaya enrolled in the Springfield school system. I have been there three times now and she is still not enrolled. They want to put her in 9th grade...

This is five minutes of writing with a few distractions and pauses.

I'm adding another sentence to I can re-sync GitHub Desktop.
