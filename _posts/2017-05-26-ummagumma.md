I couldn't think of a title just now, so I made up a nonsensical one (actually, isn't "ummagumma" the title of a Pink Floyd album?). In any case, I have no particular direction for my writing just now.

Zanaya just asked me if she could get her nose pierced. I'm not crazy about it. Valerie wants to check out the shop to make sure it is sanitary - not the response I had hoped for. I had hoped for a "Hell no" from Valerie, but I guess she thinks it's a girl thing or something like it. Why do 16-year-old girls want to pierce their noses? It's all a frustrating mystery to me.

Now it's the following day. I got distracted yesterday and never came back to it. Let me just finish this up as a short post and move on to a new one.
