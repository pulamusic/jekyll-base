I need to do two posts again today because I didn't write anything yesterday. Yesterday, though, I did work on the site because the posts from the day before weren't deploying. I finally figured out that my messing with the config file then messed up Jekyll's ability to re-build the site. I just fiddled with the config file a little bit to mess it up, so I was almost surprised when I was able to fix it. Apparently Jekyll is finicky about the state of the config file.

I don't have much to say just now. I am trying to find an avenue into my work today, and so freewriting may help. I say may rather than will or should help because I'm not feeling that optimistic today.

Fuck it.
