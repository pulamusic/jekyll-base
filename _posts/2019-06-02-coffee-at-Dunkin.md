Freewriting is cathartic, but sometimes tedious and burdensome. I find myself forcing the words, as if I don't have anything particular to say. I suppose I don't have anything to say, really, but I need to write nonetheless. It makes me feel like I've gotten a bit of a brain workout (though today I feel a bit sluggish in the head).

What the fuck? Just keep writing.

I just switched on some "concentration music;" I've put this in quotes because I'm not sure how it is supposed to work. I guess it is innocuous music that helps to drown out the ambient noise. Somehow, I think, there is supposed to be some sort of binaural beating in the background that allows one to concentrate better, but I'm wary of such claims. I have been writing much more fluently since I switched it on, though. Maybe there is something to this shit.

This reminds me of the algorithmic music software I installed on the other computer - Koan, I think it is called. It also outputs innocuous music, though I think there is a lot of room for improvisation through the manipulation of the algorithms. I should download it onto this computer as well. Let me take the time to Google it just now.

The current version of the Koan software is called [Wotja](https://intermorphic.com/wotja/). I can't download it - or any app for that matter - because I can't sort out the billing problem I have with Apple.

#### I need a fucking job!

In any event, algorithmic composition is something I have looked into in the past. I haven't gotten very far with it, but I have looked into it nonetheless. I don't really understand it, but then again, that lack of algorithmic understanding hasn't stopped me from trying to learn to code. If I had put as much effort into learning algorithmic composition as I have learning to code I would be quite well along with it.

But really, I need to just compose music in general. I have two fucking degrees in composition! (I don't know why I am drawn to using exclamation points today, but there you go.) In any event, I need to get myself set up so that I can output some stuff. I have, in the past, called myself a composer, but it has been years since I have done this. Now, when I mention that I am a musician, I call myself a guitarist...and a poor one at that. I need to get back to a place where I can rightly refer to myself as a guitarist *and* a composer. I need to be pumping out some music.

Here's what I need to do in order to enable myself as a composer:
* Set up the digital piano in a comfortable space, and don't pile up anything on top of it that doesn't have to do with playing the piano or composition.
* Get a drafting table to go with the piano so I can comfortably write on score paper.
* Ideally, get two DAWs: Pro Tools and Ableton Live. Start with Ableton live, though.
* Setup a small MIDI keyboard for input.
* Get a good audio interface and set it up so that I have immediate inputs for guitar and microphone.
* Get the best mic I can afford. Get a studio boom mic stand so I can have easy access to the mic.
* Get some nice speakers and some acoustical room treatment.
* Map this all out and price stuff on a spreadsheet.

#### 600 words. I'm getting better at this.
