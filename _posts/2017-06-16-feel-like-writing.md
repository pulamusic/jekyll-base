I just finished a post a short time ago, but I feel like writing some more. I don't have anything in particular to say, I just feel like putting more words down on screen. In fact, let me write a little bit, do something else, then write a bit more. I have already done my 500 word minimum for the day, so anything I write in this post is above and beyond.

And so, after all that energy I had early this afternoon, now it is six hours later. I've changed the time of the post to reflect when I really got back to it.

I've been thinking a lot about revision today. Not that I want to begin revising this blog - I'm sold on the usefulness of freewriting - but maybe I should start revising sooner than later. I want to keep up my 500 words-a-day goal, but I think revision is really more a part of the craft of writing than I have been giving credit. Freewriting gets the words down, and revision helps the words make sense. These freewritten posts, while fun to produce, are probably terrible writing. Of course, I won't really know for sure until I begin to re-read the posts. In fact, let me make it a project this weekend to re-read and begin revising some of what I have written. That ought to answer a few questions regarding the viability of what I am producing with this blog.

I'm not going to print out the whole damn blog, though. That would be a big project even now - I've got nearly 110 posts already. Let me start by printing out 20 or 30 of the more substantial posts and begin revising from there. Some early posts are really too thin to be of any use, so I should probably get rid of them. Otherwise, I think this blog is going better than I expected. I have produced a lot of writing while limiting myself to just a few subjects. While revising I need to be willing to throw stuff out and to freewrite some more. Like my dissertation, this writing needs to be revised several times before it will be acceptable. I'm still going to write as if nobody will read it, but finished writing really needs to be published.

In fact, I hadn't thought about publishing anything from this blog. I've been so focused on freewriting that I've hardly even thought about revision. Let me not latch onto a larger goal like publishing. It really is a step to begin revising. Let me just keep the publishing idea in the back of my brain, as something that may happen in the future. That way I don't need to begin stressing about what I write. The freewriting has been liberating for me, and I want to hang on to that feeling for as long as I can. Let me be gentle on myself.
