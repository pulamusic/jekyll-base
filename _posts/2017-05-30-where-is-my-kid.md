Zanaya apparently left school this morning after the principal confronted her for wearing a non-uniform top. My phone isn't working today because there is still a hold on my bank account, so I can't call DOR or the bank to sort this out. Since Zanaya is missing I can't go out to the DOR office or the bank. Now the police are looking for her - they've been to the house twice - and all I can do is sit here to wait for her. I'm not that worried about the kid, but I do want to find her soon. I need my baby home.

Here's another Markdown table. Atom has a table snippet that makes table creation super simple.

I can't really focus my thoughts just now. Let me post this and then write more later.
