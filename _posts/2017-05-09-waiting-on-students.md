I swear, an hour into the exam and a student walked in. Before that, one student came in, looked at the exam, and then left. I think she's been dropped from the class anyway, so I was confused to see her show up.

Let me loop a bit on the idea of critical listening or close listening or whatever you want to call it. It's important to get good stereo separation when listening to the music. Producers will often spatialize different aspects of music by panning in the stereo field or by adding reverb. That's a part of the syntax of audio production.

Now I've lost my train of thought. I didn't sleep much last night, so I'm feeling a bit dopey just now. Maybe I can be more productive this afternoon.
