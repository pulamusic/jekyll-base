Ok, now 10 minutes of freewriting.

Here I go, non-stop.

Except now I've paused.

This is another loop again, related to the last two posts. This iteration is a loop of a loop, coming third in line.

Again, a major pause. One of the things I would like to iron out with these writing exercises is the ability to maintain my focus for longer periods of time. The whole idea of freewriting is simply to get words on the page, so I am literally doing that just now. In fact, it feels a bit like I'm perseverating on an idea without having an actual idea in mind.

Oh, that's right, in the last loop I began to write about my struggles to get Zanaya enrolled in school. Or rather, I mentioned I had problems and then the timer went off. The deal is that they want to enroll her in 9th grade rather then 10th, and I can't produce anything that tells them to do otherwise. So now, on top of the debacle that has been our experience with North Star, the kid is a year behind her peers in school.

This is 10 minutes of writing with some significant pauses.
