I don't have anything particular to say, but I just felt like writing. If I end up producing a bit more text in a day that's ok with me.

One of the things I struggle with the most is that I can easily think or speak much faster than when I write. Part of the issue is that when I think an entire sentence I still need to translate my idea to paper (or screen). My typing is atrociously slow, and my handwriting, though quicker, is a mess. Ultimately, I need to adjust to writing at the keyboard. Hence the freewriting blog.

As I have hinted at in other posts, my fluency at the keyboard is becoming better. At least now I don't need to keep looking up at the screen for feedback. As for pauses in my writing, that's just part of my style. The trick is to make sure the pauses don't become full-blown distractions - all too easy with me.

That's about all I have to say just now. Just keep plugging away.
