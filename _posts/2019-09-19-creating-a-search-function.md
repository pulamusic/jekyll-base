I'm starting this post late on a Thursday, but I'm going to finish it on Friday.

**NOTE**: Update the date of this post since I'm writing most of it on Friday.

Check out the Medium article [Instant Jekyll Search](https://medium.com/@urre/instant-jekyll-search-f77065d60047).

I tried [DocSearch by Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), but they only work with open-source software projects.

I also tried [simple-jekyll-search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search), but it doesn't work...or at least the documentation is incomplete. It was a simple-ass solution, but I couldn't get it to work.

I could also try creating a [Google custom search engine](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/google-custom-search-engine/) for the site. This looks like it may be a simple procedure.
* **NOTE**: It was dead simple. Let me upload this to see if it works. If so, I can style it a bit.
* Ha, It works! In fact, searching for "JavaScript" led to me finding multiple files on algorithms I had forgotten. Cool stuff.
* Let me rearrange the layout a bit and then upload this post. I should also consider styling the search div a bit.
* Also, I need to edit the "share this" code on the bottom of the posts. Google+ is no more, and I don't really care about Pinterest, Tumblr, or Reddit.

What I really needed to have done is pay a little more attention to the categories for each post. I currently have [76 posts in the "coding" category](https://pulamusic.github.io/jekyll-base//categoryview/#coding), which really doesn't help if I want to find the three or four posts that list JavaScript algorithms, for instance.

#### This post is a little over half of my usual 500 word minimum, but I have too much to do to continue with it. I've solved the search problem, and aside from some styling, I think I should move on.
