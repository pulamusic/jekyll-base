I'm starting this post late on a Thursday, but I'm going to finish it on Friday.

**NOTE**: Update the date of this post since I'm writing most of it on Friday.

Check out the Medium article [Instant Jekyll Search](https://medium.com/@urre/instant-jekyll-search-f77065d60047).

I tried [DocSearch by Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), but they only work with open-source software projects.

I also tried [simple-jekyll-search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search), but it doesn't work...or at least the documentation is incomplete. It was a simple-ass solution, but I couldn't get it to work.
