I'm checking out the Atom text editor. I'm not really going to do a whole review, I'm just typing away, thinking through some of its options.

Visual Studio Code works with Git, which is why I have preferred it lately. But with GitHub Desktop I don't really need an editor that has Git integrated. At some point I need to study Git more closely, possibly making the shift to Git on the command line. I also need to figure out branching.

This hobby I have developed with coding is still in its beginning stages, but I feel I need to keep pressing. At the very least I need to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Maybe one way to work on this would be to write my posts in HTML rather than Markdown. Markdown is super convenient for writing, but its layout options are limited.

So far Atom seems ok, but I've only used it to write this post. The next post I'll do up in HTML.
