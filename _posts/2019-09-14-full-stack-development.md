As I go along in learning to code I find, more and more, that I am preparing myself for full-stack development. I guess that makes sense if I am going to be working by myself, but if I want a coding job I had better focus myself a bit more. For the time being, though, let me just keep working broadly like I have been.

Here's yet another breakdown of the full stack taken from two articles titled [6 Essential Tips on How to Become a Full Stack Developer](https://hackernoon.com/6-essential-tips-on-how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-1d10965aaead) and [Top Libraries + Tech to Learn in 2019 for Full Stack Developers](https://medium.com/zerotomastery/top-libraries-tech-to-learn-in-2019-for-full-stack-developers-f8c0331b8a00).

* **Front-end development**: [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

  - **Libraries**: [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* **Back-end development**: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  - **Frameworks**: [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).
  - **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/).

* **Mobile app development**: ?

The first article also suggests that a full-stack developer should at least be familiar with the process of web design,including:

* **UX design**: [research](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-research), [moodboard](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/16-great-tools-creating-mood-boards-91412793) (also check out [this article](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) on pro tips for creating better moodboards), [wireframing](https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwn_LrBRD4ARIsAFEQFKvV60Ld8PP_bt7IlpajJbrBGspdRb3m8DgJHRZbyfE2KC0iIp7lR5waAqs5EALw_wcB), [prototyping](https://www.invisionapp.com/).
* **UI design**: [general UI design](https://balsamiq.com/learn/), [high-fidelity comps](http://designforuse.net/uncategorized/high-fidelity-from-wireframes-to-comps/).

I don't have much else to say. This post is far less than 500 words, but the hyperlinks speak a lot on the subject. Needless to say, I am still sorting out wherever it is I am going with my coding studies.
