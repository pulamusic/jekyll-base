I have been coding for much of the day today, and I feel as if something is finally clicking with Bootstrap. Bootstrap is one of those CSS frameworks that requires you to know a lot of CSS classes by memory. Fortunately I don't have to memorize them all since the Bootstrap website has pretty good documentation with lots of code to steal and hack.

But this is an aside. I have been thinking about the next step with regard to blogging, and I can't say I have landed on any one approach. The two approaches I wrote about earlier today are a Sun Ra listening log or a running commentary on the news. Some combination of the two might be fun as well, as long as my output is consistent. Though I won't start out creating greatly substantive posts, my ultimate goal is to improve and expand upon my writing. The freewriting practice is stretching out my ability to maintain a narrative while composing at the keyboard. The next step in blogging needs to wed my flowing narrative idea with some more meat ("where's the beef?").

So, again, I don't need to make any decisions now, but I do need to start planning. Maybe I should consult some writing books while I'm at it.

Which reminds me that I need to crank out a book proposal. That needs to be a part of my set of writing goals. In fact, let me start a list (the order is random).

1. book proposal
2. Sun Ra listening journal
3. commentary on the news
4. a music practice journal.
5. transcriptions
6. fiction
7. what else, I don't know

Let me think on it.
