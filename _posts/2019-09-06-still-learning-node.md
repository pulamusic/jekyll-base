Learning to code is not a linear thing, I am finding out. Everything I truly learn is something I have gone over several times. I am currently working through a Udemy tutorial titled [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/), and this is probably the third time I have worked on NodeJS in some depth. The thing I like about this current tutorial, however, is that I am creating real apps that I can deploy to Heroku. I'm building out my portfolio of projects, I guess.

Let me break this down in a list of things I am currently working through. This is a helpful way for me to structure my thoughts.

* **NodeJS**: Essentially, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is just JavaScript written for the back-end. I like that I don't necessarily need to learn a new programming language, although its use is a bit more complicated. As I said above, this is really the third or fourth time I am going through a tutorial on Node, so it is a bit more clear to me this time around.
* **NPM**: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is so dead simple to use I don't know why I'm spending any effort writing about it. This is basically just a repository for JavaScript packages that make coding a lot simpler. Again, dead simple, yet very powerful.
* **Express**: [Express](http://expressjs.com/) is a NodeJS framework that makes it easier to create a web server with Node. I have used it before, but this time around it seems to have been more clear. I have already created a [weather app](https://carroll-node-weather-app.herokuapp.com/) that I was able to deploy to Heroku. This is something I can build out a bit when I have the time. I have to work on the code for the probability of precipitation since this doesn't seem to work. A simple, clean app, though.
* **MongoDB**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a database that is separate from Node but works well with it. This is probably the third time I have done a project with MongoDB, and I think I have a better grasp of it this time around; so far I have been able to follow along with the coding challenges quite easily. Recently I have worked with other SQL databases (SQLite and PostgreSQL), while MongoDB is a NoSQL database - I haven't memorized all the differences between these two types, but I basically get the picture.
* **Mongoose**: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is a Node library for using MongoDB, and it truly makes the whole process a lot simpler. So far so good, though I've just been through the basic functionality. This is probably the second or third time I've worked with Mongoose.
* **Robo 3T**: [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is a free software for managing MongoDB databases, and it is, so far, dead simple. I'm very happy to have found this.
* **Postman**: [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a software for developing and testing APIs. I have used it before, but I can't say I have understood it very well. In any event, this is one of the next things we are going to work with in the current tutorial. We'll see if I understand it any better this time around.
