I have no fucking idea what I mean by this corny title, but there we go. I'm feeling in a kind of nonsense mood. Yet another day of watching TV and avoiding my dire living situation. I'm getting food only from food pantries and food stamps, and yet I sit around watching TV on my computer all day long. Depression sucks.

Let me spend some time writing about coding; it's an easy way to get my mind off my problems. If nothing else, I'm good at avoiding my problems.

* **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the Rosetta Stone of web development, and so it deserves a lot of effort. I do understand JavaScript pretty well, but I can't say that I am comfortable with problem solving in this language just yet. Of course, this lack of comfort with problem solving is largely a result of my own laziness - I spend a lot of time Googling answers rather than working things out on my own. Maybe what I should do is to go through the algorithm exercises again, making sure I sort them out on my own.
* **React**: React is still largely a mystery to me. I get that people say it is the way forward for web development, but I haven't learned enough about it to really see this for myself.
* **NPM**: NPM is easy enough to use, but I don't yet understand when is best to use it.
* **Python**: Python is really the key to the data mining and manipulation that is common in the practice of digital humanities.
* **C**: I need to re-start the EdX ES50 course in order to re-familiarize myself with C programming. This seems like a fundamental skill-set for coding in general. Maybe I can find an EdX or Udemy course in C programming in order to shore this up. It's worth looking into at least.

Ah, fuck it. I spend too much time with this blog making lists of things I wish I was working on. The original purpose of the blog was to simply freewrite, not make lists. Maybe this is what I meant when I came up with the title "spoofing and boofing" - I have a tendency to write nonsense. This is different from freewriting. Freewriting is supposed to have some direction, even if it is unedited stuff. I need to be more clear with myself as to what I am doing with this blog.

I also need to be more consistent with regard to writing the blog in general. Maybe it's time to move beyond this blog to writing a more substantial blog - something that I put out weekly rather than (supposedly) daily. This blog has been about logorrhea (sp?), in a sense, but it may be worth my while at this point to generate a second blog with more sustained writing. Let me think about this one for a bit. I could possibly generate another Jekyll blog, Or I could re-vamp the Moon Blog I started earlier.

Again, let me think about this a bit.
