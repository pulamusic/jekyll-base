The title of this post is really a false comparison; I don't really think there is a competition between Python and JavaScript in my life. The fact is, I have spent some time learning both, and I don't feel I need to choose. Let me lay out something of a comparison, though, just to begin to flesh out my thoughts on the two programming languages.

#### JavaScript
* **Front-End Coding**: JavaScript is really the one necessary coding language for web development - HTML and CSS are markup languages - but I feel like I only have a basic grasp of it. This is one of those aspects of coding I will need to continue to work on for quite some time. In fact, my (lack of) facility with JavaScript is probably the main reason I have Impostor's Syndrome when it comes to coding. I need to just keep plugging away. Maybe I should go over the [freeCodeCamp algorithms](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting) again; I've been through them twice, so a third time won't hurt.
* **NodeJS**: JavaScript for the back-end. I don't feel comfortable with back-end development, but I do know that NodeJS is going to be important.

#### Python
* **Back-End Coding**: As I discuss a bit with regard to NodeJS, I am absolutely a novice where back-end coding is concerned. Back-end is one of those aspects of coding I will need to go over a number of times before it truly sinks in. In fact, I can already consider myself to be a front-end developer, of sorts, but I wouldn't dream of saying the same about the back-end. I'll just need to keep on with it, and I am very happy to continue working with Python
* **Flask**: This is really a back-end framework, but it also makes creating front-end user interfaces simple.
* **Django**: I've only worked a little bit with Django, but I'm sole. I particularly like how dead simple it is to create admin pages for a site

#### You know what, fuck it. I don't feel like writing anything more today. Let me publish this post with a bit more than 350 words.
