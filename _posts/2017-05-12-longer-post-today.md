## let's let it flow a bit today

Rather than pressure myself to write a certain amount in a small amount of time, I thought today I might take another tack. I'm starting this post, and I will write until I don't have anything to say. At that point I will leave the file open and ready for me to come back to it and add text. I may still push to the server when I'm done with this first round, but I will consider this post to be unfinished until the end of the day.

So that being said, I'll be back.

Here's something weird. Jekyll has stopped rendering headlines in Markdown. The headline above is posting on the internet as just two hash tags and the text. I' hope this is a kink that works itself out. I do not have the knowledge to be able to fix something as complex as this. Or maybe I should give myself more credit. In any event, it's an irritating little problem.

Now it's mid afternoon and I'm waiting for the kid to come home. I cut my hair and my beard drastically, so I'm back to the close-cropped-all-around look. In fact, my head does look best like this. I don't know why I've been letting my beard get as long as it has. Probably something to do with the divorce (bitch) aaahhh!!

Sorry.
