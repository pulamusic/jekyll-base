##let's let it flow a bit today

Rather than pressure myself to write a certain amount in a small amount of time, I thought today I might take another tack. I'm starting this post, and I will write until I don't have anything to say. At that point I will leave the file open and ready for me to come back to it and add text. I may still push to the server when I'm done with this first round, but I will consider this post to be unfinished until the end of the day.

So that being said, I'll be back.
