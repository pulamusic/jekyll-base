I don't know why Google Drive doesn't work on my laptop, but it doesn't. Ah well.

That's a weird way to start off a post. I guess if I'm truly freewriting it doesn't really matter, though. Let me just continue writing until I get me 500 words. Today I won't cut it short like I did with the last one.

I have been a bit slack with this blog over the past year. When I first started the blog I wrote every day, lining up a bunch of posts.

Lining up...that's not the wording I was looking for. Racking up is more like it. Yeah, there we go.

This past week has been a bit depressing being at mom's house. I really am the black sheep of the family at this point. Everyone else seems to be happily married and doing well in their work. It would have helped me if Zanaya had come to mom's house like she was supposed to. I'm glad she had a good Christmas, but I missed her.

Let me write a bit about coding just now. I've fallen out of the habit of coding every day since I have run out of Adderall. What I need to do, at this point, is to transition from web development to something more useful to the field of digital humanities. Python seems like it would be more useful, and definitely R. I like web development, though. I have a vague idea that I should create a large site at some point that features my academic work. Some sort of a portfolio site with a blog component would probably be best. I need to begin wireframing or outlining a site at some point.

The best way for me to approach the project would be to begin with a full UI/UX outline. I need to re-start my study of UI/UX in order to use my notes for my own project. If I have a full write-up of a site I should be able to count it toward tenure; of course, I need a tenure-track job for that to happen, but I'm working on that.

I need to submit my application for Arizona State. I also need to sort through all the job announcements I have printed out to see which other applications I can submit. This joblessness thing really sucks.

Back to coding. I need to finish the Udemy courses on Node and Junior-to-Senior development. I don't anticipate being a full-on back-end developer, but it does seem necessary to have some full-stack experience. I feel much more comfortable with the front end, though. That being said, I do need to pump out a bunch more front-end code if I am going to work with web development. I need to get more comfortable with React as well. It is just a matter of doing the work, Isuppose.

# Done with 500 words. Off to the next thing.
