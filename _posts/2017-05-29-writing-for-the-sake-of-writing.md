# ...or not

Writing for the sake of writing is not all that productive from my point of view. It is always best to have some goals in mind. That being said, I should be able to pump out text on command whether I have goals in mind or not. The trick is to relax and just write.

I know that sounds kind of goofy, but it makes sense to me. It's kind of like the advice Jack Jarrett gave our composition class while at Berklee: a composer should be able to compose music on demand. The craft of writing, like the craft of musical composition, shouldn't be dependent on "inspiration" in order to be productive. A real writer will write no matter what. In effect, this is what I am trying to accomplish with this freewriting blog: to be able to write substantively and voluminously on command.

So the idea is to write without stopping. I have a sense now as to what 500 words looks like, so I can glance at the word-count function less often. Even though I have set a goal of 350-500 words per post I want to be able to write without any external preoccupations. Word count should be about the last thing I look at.

That being said, there is some craft involved in being able to hit a particular length or word count. It's not a trivial thing. Feewriting to a certain length is one thing, but being able to edit one's writing to fit a specific length is ultimately important for getting things published. In the end, that's the goal: publishing. Writing for the sake of writing is really not all that helpful if it isn't done in service to becoming a better "published" writer.

Becoming a published writer ought to be the goal for all of my blogging. This current blog produces the raw material that can then be edited into more substantial posts for the [pulamusic.com](http://www.pulamusic.com) blog. Those posts, ultimately, can lead to better and more consistently produced writing.

On a tangent, I've just discovered that Atom does not have a print function for text. I have been using Atom to write, but now I'm not sure that's the best way to do it. In order to edit and revise these posts I really need to print them out. I have always preferred to edit with a pencil rather than doing it all online. I wonder if I can open Markdown files in MS Word.

No I can't use MS Word, but TextWrangler will allow me to print, albeit with fucked up margins. I think the best approach will be to write in MS Word and then copy and paste to a text editor for blog publication. I wonder if MS Word will allow me to save a file as Markdown.

Again, no I can't. MS Word will allow me to save something as a plain text file, so maybe that's how to do it. It's all a bit confusing since I am straddling both the coding and writing worlds. MS Word is so much better for writing, especially where I will want to begin adding citations; I can write in MS Word using Endnote for the citations, removing the citation coding fields from the Word version and saving as plain text. Either that or copy and paste. I wonder if Word's formatting will copy as well.
