This is another bog post. I don't have any particular reason to write, other than the desire to write every day. Right now I'm writing in order to procrastinate. I should be working on my Powerpoint presentation for my class tomorrow, but here I am.

So far Jekyll seems to be an excellent blog-site generator. The blog is dead simple. The only downside I see so far is that I'll need to brush up on Sass in order to do any styling. I was able to change the background color to the site, but I can't say I understand Sass at all.

Like I said, I don't really have anything to say in particular. Currently I'm just freewriting. Maybe I should follow my own recommendation and do some focused freewriting.

Nah, just fuck around. I'm not in the mood to get into anything deep. Maybe later.
