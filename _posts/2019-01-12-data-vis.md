I have been thinking again about the [data visualization challenges and projects I did while working on the freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3). I really need to re-do the challenges and then figure out my own projects. As I have written elsewhere, I believe data visualization is a good part of what I will be able to accomplish in the digital humanities. It really does warrant some more detailed work.

So I need to re-do the challenges. Cool. My memory is that they were indeed challenging (ha!), but I understood them quite well. In any case, let me start working on that today.

Otherwise, I need to be working on general JavaScript usage. I need to break with the habit I have of simply following along with tutorials....

#### You know what? I have no patience for writing today. I should just upload this post and move on with my day.
