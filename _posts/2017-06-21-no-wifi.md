The wifi is out so I won't be able to upload this post when I am done writing. I can't read the news or work on one of the coding tutorials, and I can't check my email. In general, I have become very dependent on the internet for my daily work and pleasure. I wish I was more independent of this technology, but I really seem to need the stuff.

Now it is later and the landlord has fixed the problem. I checked in on the news and now I am back to writing. I don't really feel like writing just now, but I need to forge ahead. It is important to me that I pump out at least 500 words every day. This minimum word count is beginning to feel a bit too light for me, though today it is kicking my ass.

Let me just post this and move on.
