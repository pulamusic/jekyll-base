I cleared a bunch of stuff off my desk this morning and it really does feel better. I think for a while now I've been avoiding the ever-growing pile to my left, adding to it bit by bit but still trying to ignore it. In any event, I don't feel as confined while sitting at the desk. In fact, until now I wasn't aware that I was feeling confined.

I need a desk with drawers, and a separate setup for music. Half the shit cluttering up my desk is there because I don't have a drawer to put it in. This fucking table is ok, but I need storage.

Or really, I need to get rid of a whole bunch of shit. Both things need to happen, of course, but I have the feeling that I could get rid of a whole bunch of stuff if I just got ruthless about it. I'll bet half the paper I have in file boxes could be tossed. I already threw out all the old drafts of my dissertation.

Time to get my Spring Cleaning on.
