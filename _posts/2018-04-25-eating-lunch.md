I'm in between teaching classes just now, eating my lunch and fucking around. I haven't written a post for this blog for quite a while, so let me write a bit and see how it turns out.

Really, I need to get back to writing this blog regularly. Working on this blog has helped me quite a bit at being able to write on the keyboard. I needed a way to shorten the cycle of handwriting everything and then typing it up, although that served me well for a long time. Freewriting is really about forgetting the anxieties of thinking that someone is reading what I am writing as I write it. The idea is to let go and just let the language flow without too much attention spent on punctuation, grammar, or syntax.

What the fuck is syntax, by the way. I know that it means word choice, but that's very vague in itself. I'll need to look it up.

So I got a quick and dirty definition from Wikipedia. Syntax, in linguistics, is a language's set of rules regarding word ordering and sentence structure. I know it is much more complicated than that, but this definition will do for the moment. I'm not writing an academic piece, after all.

But getting back to it - I just took a short break - I need to re-start my regular writing habit. In fact, I really need to begin working on the book manuscript. There is no excuse for my not having done this already, though I can think of some reasons, like anxiety. The fact that I haven't published anything academic is one of the things that is holding me back professionally. I really need to get on it.

And I do need to re-think the idea about publishing articles from the dissertation. I'm sure I could get two or three articles out of it. The Sun Ra chapter alone is a good article to send out. In addition, I still have the essay I wrote on Marion Brown's *Afternoon of a Georgia Faun* that needs to be brushed up and sent out somewhere.

I need to get on it, as I keep writing.

I'm going to need to cut this essay short of the 500 word goal. I have to start teaching a class in about five minutes, and I want to upload this thing before then.
