I was out late this evening doing laundry, and now it is late and I am sweating. The weather outside is cool and humid, but inside it is just humid. This house really absorbs heat during the day.

So back to the idea from my previous post regarding the need to write every day. I really do feel as if I have cheated myself when I don't do my daily writing. I have noticed a distinct shift in my ability to maintain some focus on what I am writing, and certainly my posts have become longer. For now I am going to stick with the freewriting model since this seems to be bearing some fruit for me. Ultimately, what I need is to be able to extend this freewriting technique to produce better academic writing. In the end, that's my goal.

So I have written two posts today, and I should write three tomorrow. That will catch me up. I don't want this freewriting to become a chore, but I seriously don't want to rob myself of the ability to move forward.
