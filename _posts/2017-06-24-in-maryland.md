I'm in Maryland visiting my brother and his family. Zanaya just went off to camp this morning, and I didn't have the energy to drive back to Massachusetts today. I had thought for a bit about driving back this morning so I could go to Don's barbecue, but I can't face doing that drive two days in a row.

I've noticed, in my writing, that I have a tendency to write sentences with two independent clauses with a conjunction. I need to learn to vary my use of sentence structures. Maybe I need another visit to Strunk's and White's book on writing style. What the hell is the title of that book? Ah, who knows. Actually, it's going to bug me until I look it up.

*The Elements of Style*. That's it. Brilliant little book that hits all the high points of concise writing, written with great concision. This ought to help me work out a better repertoire of sentence structures. Again, I am striving for artful repetition, not repetition as a result of ignorance. I wouldn't want to get bogged down in crafting perfect sentences while I am freewriting, but it wouldn't hurt to have a more diverse repertoire of sentence structures at my fingertips.

But this all is more helpful for writing revision. I am not yet at the point where I am revising my writing. I have, though, copied most of my blog posts to a Word file so I can print it out. So far I have 78 pages of single-spaced writing to print out and begin to edit. My first step ought to be to find the bits of writing that work best, so I can build from there.

It may be helpful for me to decide just what it is I am writing: a book, a bunch of essays...nothing so far, more likely. You never know, there could be some gold in there. I didn't have any plan in mind while I've been producing this blog. So far, at least. Maybe reading through the posts will suggest a direction for further writing. My attitude toward what I have written, ultimately, must be one of willingness to throw it all out and start over again. The real benefit of writing this blog is that I can write quickly and move on - I'm not that invested in what I am writing, so I wouldn't mind throwing it all away.

One way or another, though, I need to make what I write more meaningful. I do need to have some plan as to where this writing project is going in order to turn this writing exercise into part of my professional practice. This is why I want to find some sort of useful writing within the posts I have already written. Even if I could use only five pages of what I have written so far that would be useful. I hope it will be more, but five pages will be c.2500 words of useful writing. That's a start by any measure.
