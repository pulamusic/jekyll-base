Let me riff a bit on playing the guitar again. I go through these awful periods where I don't play guitar. In fact, I haven't played any guitar in more than six months. It always helps to get out of these non-guitar funks if I have some sort of plan as to what I want to do. Of course, any decent plan starts off with some sort of freewriting/brainstorming. Let me break down a few things in outline form.

* Keep in mind that what I am really concerned with is musical practice - guitar is just an instrument. I really need to fully consider composition and piano proficiency and a few other things separate from the guitar. Guitar just happens to be my primary instrument, though, so for the sake of efficiency I just makes sense that I work out musical ideas on the guitar.
* **jazz**: Work up, again, the Morgen fingerstyle stuff that I have had memorized in the past. Work out some lead sheet arrangements of the same tunes, learning to play the melodies, basslines (two-feel, walking, etc.), and comping. See if I can work out a solo accompaniment part so that I can accompany a melodic instrument.
* **blues**: Work on some nasty Chicago blues stuff, and then see how it connects to the more country stuff that I play. Also, reconsider Wes Montgomery
* **improvisation**: I need to re-invigorate my single-note playing somehow. I could focus for a bit on pentatonic scales as a way to simplify things a bit. Practice them along with Arnold's Metrodrone sound files.
* **comping**: I need to get back to working on walking bass for the guitar. I just need to memorize the stuff. And use a fucking metronome.
* **reading**: Read something regularly. Learn to play the Bartok piano stuff on the guitar as well. Read from scores. Read the *Omnibook*. Work on my rhythm playing and reading through Arnold's books on rhythms, Goodrick's book *Factorial rhythm*, or any other source I can find. Read from the *Real book*. Memorize some fucking tunes, but also breeze through sight readings of various other tunes.
* **composition**: Get back to working on Schoenberg's *Theory of harmony*. Write out the exercises in different keys and play them at the piano and on guitar.
* **piano**: Play all compositional exercises from Schoenberg. Continue working on Bartok's *Mikrokosmos* as well as Haerle's book on jazz chords for class piano.
* **ear training**: Continue working with Arnold's ear training sound files and sight singing exercises. Keep in mind that ear training has always paid off for me, so I should take more joy in this too-oft maligned aspect of musical training.
* **score reading**: While this really goes with composition, it also touches on ear training, reading, piano, as well as guitar practice. I won't spend much energy on writing about this one.
