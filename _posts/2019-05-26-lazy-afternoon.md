This is my second post for the day. After writing it I will use my phone as a hotspot so I can up load the post to my blog. It's interesting to me that I am still writing this blog. I lost the other blog because I can no longer afford to pay for it. This blog, however, gets hosted for free on GitHub Pages. I should see if I can somehow upload all of these posts to a Wordpress.com site, which, if I'm not mistaken, should be free.

I should also think about changing all my online accounts to my gmail account, though I still have a year left on my pulamusic email. As much as possible I need to shift my online activity to free services just in case my depressed financial position keeps carrying on as it has. I'm really in a bad state right now, and it would be best if I can look for ways to cut out expenses.

But fuck all this, I need to write some more about musical practice. I have been trying to outline a practice schedule on Microsoft Excel, but it really doesn't produce the kind of graphic I want to create in order to upload it online. Maybe if I create a table using MS Word I should be able to export the table as a graphic. In fact, I think I'll try that after I finish writing this post.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on the main areas of musical practice I have been using to organize my thoughts.

* **Guitar**: This is where I need to spend most of my effort, at least for now. If I can't play the guitar I have no cause to call myself a musician. All decent musicians I know have at least some virtuosic ability on one instrument. The real key, in fact, is repertoire. I need to have not only a pre-planned performance repertoire, but also the ability to learn new tunes and play multiple parts. I also need to be able to improvise. As such, I need to put as much effort into transcribing tunes as I do learning pre-planned arrangements.
* **Composition**: In the past, I've put a lot of effort into learning how to compose music, and then I just stopped. I need to not only pick it up again, but also move forward. To this end I need to get back to working on Schoenberg's *Theory of Harmony* and Wuorinen's *Simple Composition* as well as works by Piston, Hindemith, Perle, Straus, etc. But mostly, I just need to compose music. I need to have a performance repertoire that I can bring to groups of musicians and say, "Here's some original shit we can play." I have some tunes already, but everything I have is 10-15 years old at this point. I need to have some stuff that is much more current. I need to do and improve.
* **Musicianship**: Most of this should be done at the piano, either working on my functional piano skills or doing ear training exercises. I had some halfway decent piano proficiency at one point, but I let it slide. All I need to do is work a bit to get it back. In addition, I need to get back in the habit of working with Arnold's ear training CDs. Those CDs have been greatly helpful in moving forward, especially the *Fanatic's Guide* and the *Key Note Recognition* CDs.

#### With all of this stuff I know what the fuck I need to do - I just need to do it.
