For the second day now I have posted something in the morning only to not see it show up on the blog. I thought Jekyll rebuilt the site every time I made a commit to the master.

Anyway, yesterday when the post didn't show up I uploaded a second page and, voila, there was the earlier post. Let's see what happens.
