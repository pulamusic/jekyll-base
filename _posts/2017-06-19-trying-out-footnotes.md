Let me try out the footnotes functionality in Markdown. I think I just figured it out, which will be very handy.

Let me put a footnote here [^1]. And another one here [^2]. And finally, one more [^3].

It works! Very cool.

_____________

[^2]: Kivy, Peter. 1979. *The Fine Art of Repetition*.

[^1]: Gates, Henry Louis. 1983. *The Signifying Monkey*, p. xiv.

[^3]: This is some text in a footnote.
