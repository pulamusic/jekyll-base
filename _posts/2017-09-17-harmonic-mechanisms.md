I've been away from this blog for an extended hiatus. Since I've been away I have been practicing the guitar regularly. Below is a rough (incomplete) outline of a section of Van Eps's *Harmonic Mechanisms* I am working on. My impression is that the end result of these exercises should be to be able to keep melodic lines moving within a harmonic context.

It's all about moving lines baby!
