# some success

I have found a way to embed PowerPoint presentations online using Google Docs. When I open a presentation to view one of the extra options is the embed code. Let me test out whether this will work in Markdown.

Yes! it works very well. This may be one of the best ways to share my teaching materials. I will need to re-write the presentations, though, since the embedded videos don't work in the embedded version of these presentations. Something to work on.
