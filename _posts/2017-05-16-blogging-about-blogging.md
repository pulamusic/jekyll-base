I don't have a strong reason why I chose the title I did. I guess I thought it might be time for a little meta-commentary on the process of this so-called blog. It is a blog, that's for sure, but its contents are nonsense to anyone but me. My purpose with this entire blog is to become more comfortable with freewriting on the computer. If I can cut out the middle media of pen and paper I can improve on the productivity of my writing. In other words, I am just writing for the sake of writing, purposefully choosing to not edit what I have written (except for a few typos here and there).

So there is no deep message in what I'm writing in this blog, though there is some thought as to the purpose of writing it - simply to produce text and to become more fluent at freewriting on the computer. That's it. At some point I'll probably delete this blog, though I guess I could just continue as it is. I also want to figure out how to style the pages, but that's going to entail really learning either Sass or Less (I can't yet tell which CSS preprocessor is being used). I'm still a newbie at this web development stuff.
