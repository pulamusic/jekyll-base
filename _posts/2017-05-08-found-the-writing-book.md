I found the book I was looking for, but I had mixed up the title. The book I was looking for is *A Troubleshooting Guide for Writers: Strategies and Process* by Barbara Fine Clouse (2010), not *Writing Strategies*. There is a separate book titled *Research Strategies* I have used before.

Here's an interesting concept to check out: looping (Clouse 2010: 22). The idea is that you freewrite on an idea. Then, upon reading back what you have written, choose a particular piece of what you have written and do some more freewriting. Keep repeating the cycle as long as you can, looping through new ideas or new perspectives on ideas. This is similar to what I wrote about in my last post - drilling down on an idea. Looping seems to break the task down while keeping it focused.

I'm wandering again. The idea with this blog is to freewrite, but the blog ensures that I need to do my writing on the computer. At some point, though, I would like to switch back to pen and paper, freewriting on paper and typing up a first edit of what I have written. For now, I'll just stick to freewriting directly to the blog.

I hope to hell nobody stumbles across this blog and reads it. So far it probably reads like a fucking mess.
