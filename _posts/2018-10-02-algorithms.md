[These algorithms](https://github.com/pulamusic/algorithms) are from a [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) course titled [Learning Algorithms in JavaScript From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/learn/v4/content). Each algorithm is assigned a separate folder, `index.html` file, and `main.js` file. (I have also, now, copied all the code to repl.it files and linked them on this page.) Here is a list of the algorithms in order:

1. [FizzBuzz](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/fizzBuzz)
2. [Harmless Ransom Note](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/harmlessRansomNote)
3. [Is Palindrome](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/isPalindrome)
4. [Caesar Cipher](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/caesarCipher)
5. [Reverse Words](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/reverseWords)
6. [Reverse Array in Place](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/reverseArray)
7. [Mean Median Mode](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/meanMedianMode)
8. [Two Sum](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/twoSum)
9. [Binary Search](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/binarySearch)
10. [Fibonacci](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/fibonacci)
11. [Memoized Fibonacci](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/memoizedFibonacci)
12. [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/sieveOfEratosthenes)
13. [Bubble Sort](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/bubbleSort)
14. [Merge Sort](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/mergeSort)
15. [Max Stock Profit](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/maxStockProfit)

In addition, here is another algorithm, not from the Udemy tutorial:
1. [Longest Word](https://repl.it/@jgCarroll/longestWord)

I know I have more algorithms like this last one; I just haven't written them up as of yet.

The idea in learning these JavaScript algorithms is to learn how to better problem solve with code. Many of these particular algorithms are used in coding job interviews as a means of sorting out how applicants problem-solve.

Also check out my notes on the Udemy course [JavaScript Interview Prep](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-interview-prep/learn/v4/questions) on my [freewriting blog](https://pulamusic.github.io/jekyll-base//coding/2018/02/18/coding-notes.html) as well as in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pulamusic/codingInterviewQuestions).

Notes are in the `.js` files. `Index.html` files are only created for console output. I will eventually transfer all these algorithms to repl.it files (done), embedding them in the `index.html` files for convenience sake (done).
