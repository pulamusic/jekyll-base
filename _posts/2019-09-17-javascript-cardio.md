This is a collection of JavaScript algorithms taught by Brad Traversy in a short series of YouTube videos titled *JavaScript Cardio*. I like to collect algorithm exercises in case I ever need to do a coding interview, so here are a bunch more.

Most of the algorithms in these videos have multiple solutions; I've included some of them in [my own notes on the videos](https://github.com/pulamusic/JavaScriptCardio). For further examples look at [Brad's repo for the videos](https://github.com/bradtraversy/javascript_cardio), in particular paying attention to the `index_extra.js` files where students are encouraged to submit their own unique solutions to the algorithms via pull requests.

Here is a list of the algorithms covered in each video. Note that I have written about some of these algorithms elsewhere (for instance, [here](https://pulamusic.github.io/jekyll-base//coding/2017/12/23/javascript-algorithms.html), [here](https://pulamusic.github.io/jekyll-base//coding/javascript/2018/10/02/algorithms.html), and [here](https://pulamusic.github.io/jekyll-base//coding/javascript/2018/11/29/more-algorithms.html)), but it is good to re-visit these algorithms from time to time.

* [JavaScript Cardio Session 1](https://youtu.be/M2bJBuaOeOQ)
  - **reverseString**: Return a string in reverse.
  - **isPalindrome**: Return true if palindrome and false if not
  - **reverseInt**: Return an integer in reverse
  - **capitalizeLetters**: Return a string with the first letter of every word capitalized.
  - **maxCharacter**: Return the character that is most common in a string.
  - **fizzBuzz**: Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

  - **longestWord**: Return the longest word of a string.
  - **chunkArray**: Split an array into chunked arrays of a specific length.
  - **flattenArray**:  Take an array of arrays and flatten to a single array.
  - **isAnagram**: Return true if anagram and false if not.
  - **letterChanges**: Change every letter of the string to the one that follows it and capitalize the vowels.

  - **addAll**: Return a sum of all parameters entered regardless of the amount of numbers - NO ARRAYS.
  - **sumAllPrimes**: Pass in a number to loop up to and add all of the prime numbers. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
  - **seekAndDestroy**: Remove from the array whatever is in the following arguments. Return the leftover numbers in an array.
  - **sortByHeight**: Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.
  - **missingLetters**: Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it. If all letters are present, return undefined.
  - **evenOddSums**: Take in an array and return an array of the sums of even and odd numbers.
