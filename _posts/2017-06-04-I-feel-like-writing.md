The major benefit I have noticed in producing this freewriting blog is that I want to write more often. This is now my third post of the day, and I am not struggling to find motivation. I have some free time, and so I am drawn to writing. The 500 word goal feels eminently doable - not too long, but just long enough to feel satisfying. Usually I am able to keep writing until I'm done, though just now I feel a bit distracted.

I was just re-reading part of *The Craft of Writing* with regard to drafting. The authors recommend freewriting a first draft with the assumption that most of the text will not survive in that state. I have found that when I freewrite sections of my academic writing, most of the freewritten text makes it into the final draft. The authors of *The Craft of Writing* seem to suggest that multiple revisions is the way to go for substantive writing. I agree, and yet a good deal of my dissertation is really just second draft text.

That being said, I do not wish to repeat the experience I had writing my diss. Don't get me wrong, I loved most of the process, but at the time I was still writing in a slow, sentence-by-sentence fashion, eking out my words like a dentist pulling teeth. Freewriting, on the other hand, feels much more natural. In fact, one of the issues I have with writing is that I can't possibly write as quickly as I can speak. When I speak the words come right out. Writing - whether it is typing or writing by hand - is a naturally slower process. I wish I could simply forget about the rules of grammar and syntax as I write, as that would make things faster. This freewriting blog, though, has greatly improved the flow of my writing.

This blog has also re-introduced me to the idea of writing for the sake of writing. Writing, for me, has long been a utilitarian skill: something to use for academic work, and not much more. Writing for the sake of writing is more about having fun and exploring some ideas. Even now, I should go back and revise the last sentence - I don't like it - but I won't. Freewriting is about moving forward no matter what; it's about getting the words down.

I really should be writing this blog using MS Word. If I plan to re-write any of it in the future I will need to have it in some sort of printable form. Atom doesn't have a print function. I like Atom's simplicity, but it is built for coding, not writing. In the end, I am a writer in the making rather than a diehard code geek. I do need to use Atom to create the Markdown files for the blog, but I could easily copy-and-paste from Word files. As it is, if I want to revise any of the blog text I have written so far I will need to copy the text, file by file, into Word.

Maybe one of my goals with this blog should be to produce first draft text for a book-length project. That would require a little bit of planning, but, as I am finding, producing the raw text is just a matter of pumping out a little at a time. The trick is going to be finding a subject worth writing about. And yet again, that subject may already be there in what I have written so far. I know it's a cliche, but if writing is about finding out what I think, I may already have stumbled upon an idea worth writing about. Time to begin re-reading the blog posts to see if there is a nugget or two in there, breaking from my practice of writing and moving on.

Time to start milking this process.
