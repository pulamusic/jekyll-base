I'm back at it after teaching my class this morning. I had maybe 6 or 7 students show up, and one of them has been dropped from the class already. I don't know what happened over the course of the semester, but the attendance was atrocious all term.

I don't really have much to say, so let me just freewrite for a while. I'm getting a bit better at writing nonstop, but I still tend to look up at the screen.

And now, today, I'm struggling to keep at it. If I just think of something other than writing I may get somewhere.

Or not.
