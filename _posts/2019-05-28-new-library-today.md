I'm trying out the new library at STCC today, and so far so good. My faculty login still works here so the internet connection was automatic. Nice new place. Last year when I was teaching at STCC the building was still under construction. Mark from the shelter swears by this place, so I thought I would give it a go. I like it.

I wish I was still teaching here. I love teaching history, and this is the place where I woke up to that fact. Not that I wasn't teaching history before, just music history. But I find, as I go along, that I like to ground musical events and artifacts in a larger cultural history. Teaching straight-up history at STCC has helped me to broaden my thinking a bit.

What I need now is a full time teaching gig. I just need some work in general, but teaching would be best. In fact, let me take the time just now to see if I can connect with the new Dean.

## Ha!

As luck would have it there is a current job opening for Assistant Dean of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies at STCC. I took the time to submit an application, so I'm feeling pretty good about myself just now. I'll keep my fingers crossed. $80,000 - $90,000: not bad. I could really go for that just about now. I could really go for anything, in fact, but why not shoot for something that is up my professional alley.

I like the fact that I have taken up writing this blog again, though I am beginning to question the value of only freewriting. I eventually need to move on the something more substantial. Even when I was doing the pulamusic.com blog it was just quick and dirty, mostly posting YouTube videos of music I liked. What might be more helpful is a running blog of reviews of Fela's or Sun Ra's recorded works along with some lit review type thingies. I'll have to put some thought into it. Maybe something where I commit to creating one substantial post per week, working on it a bit every day.

I'll think about it.

I like to write, but I never end up writing what I should be writing. I should be working on the book MS, but instead I am still fucking around with freewriting and diddling with whatever I am producing with GitBook. What the fuck am I doing with GitBook, by the way? It is not publicly available so I can't think of these GitBooks as blogs or something of the kind. In fact, I think a full on blog regarding musical practice might be a good place for me to focus my efforts. Since Wordpress seems to no longer be free, I think I should check out Blogger again. Mark Anthony Neal has a very cool blog using Blogger. Let me look into it.

#### 500 words. Onto the next thing.
