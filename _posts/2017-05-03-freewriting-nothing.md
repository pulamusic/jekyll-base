Nothing to start off with; no ideas popping out. I'll just keep writing. Even a little bit of hesitation makes me nervous. I don't really know why, but I seem to have convinced myself that halting during freewriting is cheating. It isn't, of course, but I am trying to habituate myself to longer bouts of writing. It's the hesitation that kills me.

The other thing I have been doing since I began to work on my freewriting is that I look at the keyboard and try to avoid looking at the screen. When I look at the screen I see my mistakes, and I then want to begin editing. Even a few minutes ago I looked up at the screen, saw an error, and fixed it. It was just the one edit, but it threw off my flow. I'm not going to go so far as to turn off my computer monitor, but it may help at some point.
