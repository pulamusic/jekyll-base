So it's a while later now. Let me see if I can freewrite more productively.

Productive in terms of ideas. Writing non-stop is one thing, but it gets boring quickly if I have nothing to say.

I have been thinking a lot about this story I heard in the news a while ago; an active duty Navy SEAL was found to have performed in a whole bunch of porn films, many of them with his wife. I don't really know what's bugging me about the story, except to say that I find it incredible that someone who made a career out of being a SEAL would jeopardize his career like that. Or, possibly, the dude doesn't see any conflict between his work life and his other work life; maybe this kind of behavior is the dude's normal. Porn has become so mainstreamed now.

This isn't working for me today. I need to figure out some writing exercises to get me going. I know I have a few books about writing lying around somewhere.
