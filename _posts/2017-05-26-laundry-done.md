I finished my laundry and now I'm back writing again. I'm also on hold with the DOR again because they haven't released the hold on my bank account yet. This has to be sorted out today or I'm stuck for the weekend with a negative $3600 balance. Fucking DOR.

I think the DOR thing is sorted out. I'll have to check my bank account in a while to make sure.

While I was doing laundry I read a book about CoffeeScript. It sounds simple, but in a complex way. I still need to know how JavaScript works in order to write CoffeeScript, but the syntax for CoffeeScript is shit simple. Once I am more comfortable with JavaScript, CoffeeScript should be easy.

The fact that CoffeeScript is a JavaScript preprocessor reminds me that I know a little Sass as well. Or rather, I know enough Sass to know that I really don't know Sass. I haven't found CSS to be a drag to write, so I'm not sure about the value of a preprocessor. I guess it's just one of those things that will make sense to me when I find I have a need for it. For now, plain CSS is fine with me.

Speaking of coding, maybe I could begin to list the languages I will ultimately need to know in order to become a decent web developer.

1. HTML/CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Python
4. Git
5. Sass
6. CoffeeScript
7. Ruby

Also, the Google Developers site has a whole bunch of stuff on coding for smart phones which would be interesting to get into at some point. I have been focused on full size websites when the real trend is toward using phones.

I just solved a writing problem. There is an Atom package that does word and character count. Now I know just how long each post is. This will make it easier to hit my target.
