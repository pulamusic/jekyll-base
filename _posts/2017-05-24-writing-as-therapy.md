This is a total cliche, but this freewriting blog is becoming cathartic. I look forward to doing the writing, and I don't sweat about how long I write.

Well, maybe I do care a bit. I think my goal per post ought to be at least two or three substantive paragraphs. At some point I should increase that goal, but for now I like that I am not pressuring myself to produce a lot every day.

Instead, I should spend some of my freewriting time planning the next phase of writing practice. I have been toying with a couple of ideas, like daily blogging about news articles (similar to the way I used to write long comments on Huffington Post), or daily blogging about music I listen to (the Sun Ra catalog idea). For now I'll continue with the freewriting, maybe directing it more toward planning. In any case, the next step should be where I begin to use pulamusic.com regularly. The WordPress site is just sitting there unused. I have needed to revive that site for some time now.

But I like the idea of a blog of my notes on listening to Sun Ra's whole catalog. Or maybe I should just specify a couple of albums and blog one tune a day. I will need to do some thinking as to what I am listening for. My notes could include some transcription, key centers, harmonies, rhythms, etc. They could also include commentary on the music or on the liner notes or on some image of Sun Ra I find somewhere. There ought to be some sort of standard outline that I use for each composition, allowing for each tune to have its own narrative while adding some sense of thematic development over to course of the blog.

In other words, what I need to do with the rest of my time with this freewriting blog is plan for the next step. The next step is where the writing begins. Don't get me wrong, freewriting is writing, for sure. But it will feel good to stretch out a bit. For now, though, I need to keep banging away according to the plan.
