I don't really have anything to say, but that is not the point of freewriting. I should be able to write no matter how I feel. Let me just bang out 500 words and move on.

I have still been doing a lot of coding. In addition to the PluralSight tutorials I have been working on a tutorial from [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) that is walking me through a bunch of projects using JavaScript and jQuery. I like the pace of the tutorial, though I do have to pause the videos quite often to catch up with my code. I like that We do the projects from scratch, generating the HTML and CSS files as well as the JavaScript. So far we haven't done anything I haven't done before, but I am understanding the process much better. Ultimately, I would like to be able to code a project on my own without the need of a tutorial, but this is a goal, not an instant state of being. Patience.

I have also been working on some Ruby tutorials on both Codecademy and PluralSight. I do sort-of get it with the Codecademy tutorial, but the guy on PluralSight just blasts ahead without moving incrementally through the material. I'm sure his videos would make a lot more sense to me if I was more conversant with Ruby, but I'm not there yet. I'll hang in a bit longer to see how it goes before I ditch the dude. I may be getting more from him than I realize.

Let me see if I can break down the rest of what I want to write. It seems to work best when I first propose some sort of outline.

**Ruby**: This is pretty new to me, so I'm going to take my time with it. I need to put most of my effort into JavaScript, so Ruby should take a back seat. But, as well, I'm not yet sure Ruby is the back-end language I should throw my effort behind. Maybe Python or Node.js. I'll keep on with the Ruby tutorials for now, but I'm still wary.

**JavaScript**: JavaScript is clearly a necessary language for web design and development, so I really need to put most of my energy in this direction. It's been a difficult language for me to master, though I am getting it more and more all the time. I just need to keep doing what I am doing, and it should come.

**HTML/CSS**: I have continued to improve at both HTML and CSS coding as I go along. Basically, any project I do has HTML and CSS as part of the base user interface. I recently did a PluralSight tutorial on HTML5 that taught me a few new things, but mostly I learn by just doing. I'm much more comfortable with both of these, so I have no real concerns about how I should learn them.

**Git on the Command Line**: I do know how to do Git on the command line, but I mostly use the GitHub desktop app to keep track of files. I would like to, at some point, force myself to do it all on the command line so I can begin to see what people are talking about with regard to its power. So far, the desktop app has been great, but there may be some limitations I'm not yet aware of.
