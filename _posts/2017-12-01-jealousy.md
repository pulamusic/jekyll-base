I have to say that one of the reasons I don't like Facebook is that it sometimes reminds me how well others are doing professionally while I'm stuck in an unemployed funk. I just saw a post from McKinley Melton indicating that he got tenure with a promotion to associate professor. Damnation. I deserve a job too, and baby boy is doing so well. I hate that I am jealous, but I can't deny it. Probably better to write about something else.

I've been working on my coding some more today. Let me try adding a big block of code to this post. That ought to help me feel better about my day.

```javascript
// Include data for accessing Google APIs

const apiKey = 'AIzaSyANUcTGVdxDjikK-0lMoP3MIOfV_-dxVv0';
const url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/urlshortener/v1/url';
const projection = 'FULL';

// Some page elements

const $inputField = $('#input');
const $expandButton = $('#expand');
const $shortenButton = $('#shorten');
const $responseField = $('#responseField');

// AJAX functions

function expandUrl() {
	const urlToExpand = url + '?key=' + apiKey + '&shortUrl=' + $inputField.val();
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
  xhr.responseType = 'json';
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
      //console.log(xhr.response);
      $responseField.append('<p>Your expanded url is: </p><p>' + xhr.response.longUrl + '</p>');
    }
  }
  xhr.open('GET', urlToExpand);
  xhr.send();
}

function shortenUrl() {
	const urlWithKey = url + '?key=' + apiKey;
  const urlToShorten = $inputField.val();
  const data = JSON.stringify({longUrl: urlToShorten});
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;
  xhr.responseType = 'json';
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
      //console.log(xhr.response);
      $responseField.append('<p>Your shortened url is: </p><p>' + xhr.response.id + '</p>');
    }
  }
  xhr.open('POST', urlWithKey);
  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  xhr.send(data);
}

function expand() {
  $responseField.empty();
  expandUrl();
  return false;
}

function shorten() {
  $responseField.empty();
  shortenUrl();
  return false;
}

// Call functions on submit

$expandButton.click(expand);
$shortenButton.click(shorten);
```

I hope this comes out the way I want when I post it to the internet. Sometimes I can't predict the behavior of what my markdown posts are going to look like, even with the markdown preview function in Atom.

Fuck my 500 word minimum just now. I'm really not in the mood to push through. Jealousy has taken hold, and I can't shake it.

I need to take a shower.
