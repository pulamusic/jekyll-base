Today is the day after Christmas, and I am sitting on a couch in my mom's house, typing in an awkward position. In fact, let me move to a table.

Now I've got some more coffee and I'm sitting at a table. I'm blanking on what to write, but as with most freewriting I need to just keep going.

I haven't been coding much lately since I ran out of Adderall. I really need to take stock of why I code, making a hard shift to digital humanities. This means I need to spend more effort on learning R or something like it. In fact, let me take the time just now to download the software.

Now I have downloaded both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I need to re-do the R tutorials from [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/), especially the mapping tutorials. At some point I would like to map out something like the Black Arts Movement music events, or the possible intersections of Sun Ra and Fela...or maybe something to do with FESTAC77. Who knows.

Really, I need to re-start my writing rather than focusing so much on coding. This is the real reason I am having so little luck with my job search.

Now it's a couple hours later and I am watching TV while writing. I just checked out the Programming Historian site and found a tutorial on how to create an API with Python and Flask. I'll have to check that out.

I'm having no luck with the writing today. Let me just upload this post as it is, with less than 300 words.

# Fuck It
