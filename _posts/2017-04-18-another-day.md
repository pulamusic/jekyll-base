#...yes, another day#

Let me just play around a bit with Markdown. It's a dead simple language, but I'm not satisfied with the way it presents photos. The text doesn't wrap around the image like a floated image in html. I suppose the solution is that I should write any multi-media blog posts in html. As long as I include the Markdown header html works great.

I don't have anything much to say. My irritating neighbor just let her friend in the building. The friend arrived outside and shouted, "Yo! KK!" Didn't ring the bell. Didn't call "KK." The front door to this building is just outside the window next to my desk. I really don't have a better spot for the desk in my apartment, so I have to deal with idiots shouting and smoking on the front steps and clomping up and down the stairs and moving furniture, it seems, upstairs. I've shouted at this woman twice now for using the n-word out in public. It really fucking offends me, and she's got this white-woman-thinks-she's-trying-to-act-black thing going on when she's angry. In the end she's only acting like an asshole, so I yell at her like an adult scolding a child. I know it's paternalistic, but she really pushes my buttons.

Maybe I had more to say than I thought. I'll tell you, this woman really irritates me. There's this constant ruckus of friends coming in, then going downstairs to smoke on the front step, then back upstairs, over and over, every day.

I need a vacation. That's it. I need a warm place where nobody will bother me so I can just swim and read and drink cold beer. That's what I'll focus on. As soon as I get a decent paying job I'll start putting away.... Fuck it. I'm imagining a Caribbean vacation. This is about VJ. Ah now, I guess I'll have to think it through. I really have come to love the Caribbean, so I can't just say that my desire to go to the Caribbean is about my ex-wife. She may be from the Caribbean - or rather, she's first generation American - but I can find my own part of the Caribbean where I can plant myself in the water, drink a beer, and watch the boats go by. I want to go snorkeling. Fuck it. Let me start figuring out where I want to go.
