Well Atom isn't working today, so I'm back to Visual Studio Code. I need to just settle on one text editor and stick with it.

I haven't posted for four days. I swear it feels like I just wrote a post yesterday. In any event, the idea with this blog is to write every day, no matter what. The way that I look at it, I owe myself four separate blog posts in order to catch myself up. I don't want to miss out on an opportunity to learn.

So let me not labor on too long, though I should try to create posts with some substance. Of course, the substance is only relevant to my life and to the goals I have set for myself in improving my writing. I do need to remind myself, though, that the overall strategy I have put in motion with this blog is to simply loosen up my writing, making me more comfortable with writing at the keyboard.

Another step in becoming more fluent at writing at the keyboard, I suppose, it to improve my typing. As it is I need to look at the keyboard while I type, which is probably very inefficient. My typing instruction, such that it was, consisted of me sitting at the typewriter with a good sized beer next to me, picking out letters with painful slowness, punctuated only by gulps of beer. As it is now, I type with only three fingers on one hand and two on the other.

Let me post this, mid thought, and write some more again later. I have to go do laundry, and I have been procrastinating all day.
