I can't sleep just now, so I thought I would get a head start on my day. I was going to write three posts today anyway.

I'm a little confused just now because I haven't gone to sleep from yesterday. Now it's 2:00 AM and so today is the day ahead, not behind. So today, Monday, I am going to write three posts, and this is the first.

I'm quite annoyed with a number of my students. Seven of the registered students didn't bother to show up for the final exam. In every case the students' attendance was very low, so really I should be giving out seven Fs. This I don't want to do. I assigned grades to the students who did take the exam - most of whom did very well - and left the others empty. This may be a problem with my supervisor. Technically, her office is supposed to be on the students about their attendance and such, but I suppose she wouldn't know to harass a student about attendance unless I told her about some lapse. In any case, I always find it disheartening to assign an F to a student. It feels bad.

Let me post this and try to get some sleep.
