##headings still don't work

Coding is fascinating, but sometimes it frustrates the hell out of me. I know the problem with the headings started after I pushed changes from my laptop. I think that changed the file structure of the repository somehow. On top of this, none of the photos on the site work.

Again, today, I think I'll dispense with the rigorous time limit for freewriting. Instead, I'll write some now and some later.
