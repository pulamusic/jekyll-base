## headings still don't work

Coding is fascinating, but sometimes it frustrates the hell out of me. I know the problem with the headings started after I pushed changes from my laptop. I think that changed the file structure of the repository somehow. On top of this, none of the photos on the site work.

Again, today, I think I'll dispense with the rigorous time limit for freewriting. Instead, I'll write some now and some later.

So now it's later.

I need to clear off my desk and organize myself for the change that's going on in my job situation. The class has ended, so I think I get one more paycheck. At least I think so. In any event, I'm jobless again. Jobless and stoned and feeling like I'm ready for Spring cleaning. It's a rainy day today, so maybe not today, but at least I can start with organizing my desk. There is a pile of paper here that I'm almost too intimidated to look. Fuck it, here I go.

Didn't end up clearing my desk. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on with my site when I noticed that the url had changed - I wonder if Netlify got hacked. The url is now that for the GitHub repository. When I try to open pulablog.netlify.com it creates a weirdly formatted page with a gigantic cat logo and what looks like unstyled html. Very frustrating.
