<![Jim Carroll](media/photo1.jpg)>

My name is Jim Carroll. I am an academic and musician living in Western Mass. As an academic, I specialize in the cultural history of some musicians associated with the Black Arts and Black Power Movements of the 1960s. As a musician, I play blues and jazz, and I gig far too little.

No, I am not the <a href="http://www.catholicboy.com" target="_blank">Jim Carroll</a> who wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Diaries-Classic-Growing-Streets/dp/0140100180/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1496077294&sr=8-2&keywords=the+basketball+diaries" target="_blank">*The Basketball Diaries*</a>; nor am I the <a href="http://www.jamescarroll.net/JAMESCARROLL.NET/WELCOME.html" target="_blank">James Carroll</a> who writes for the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/" target="_blank">*Boston Globe*</a>. It is a handsome name, though, isn't it?
