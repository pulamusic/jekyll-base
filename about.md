My name is Jim Carroll. I am an academic and musician living in Western Mass.

As an academic, I specialize in the cultural history of some musicians associated with the Black Arts and Black Power Movements of the 1960s. As a musician, I play blues and jazz, and I gig far too little.

No, I am not the Jim Carroll who wrote *The Basketball Diaries*; nor am I the James Carroll who writes for the *Boston Globe*. It is a handsome name, though, isn't it?
